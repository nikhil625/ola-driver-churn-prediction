Ola Driver Churn Prediction using Ensemble Learning
Business Problem

Driver churn directly impacts ride availability and revenue stability.
The objective of this project is to predict which drivers are likely to leave the platform so that proactive retention strategies can be implemented.

 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

Random Forest

XGBoost

Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Handling Class Imbalance

Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

Key Insights

Drivers with low quarterly ratings show higher churn probability

Income patterns strongly influence retention

Short tenure drivers are more likely to churn

Ensemble models improved predictive performance over baseline models

 Business Impact

This model can help identify high-risk drivers early and enable targeted retention programs, reducing churn and improving operational efficiency.
