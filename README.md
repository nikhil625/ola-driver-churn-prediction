# ola-driver-churn-prediction
Built a machine learning model to predict driver churn for Ola using ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost. Performed data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to identify key factors influencing driver retention.
